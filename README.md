# Conditional Profile Card

## DOM manipulation exercises

##### Made by Rodrigo Carvalho

------------

### Task:
In this exercise you have to create the HTML code needed to render a profile card based on a series of variables that could change in value during runtime. Here is an example of the profile card:

![Conditional Profile Card](https://github.com/breatheco-de/exercise-conditional-profile-card/blob/master/preview.gif?raw=true)
Inside the src/app.js file there is a `render` function that receives variables and contains the logic to create most of the website HTML code.

```js
function render(variables = {}) {
  document.querySelector("#widget_content").innerHTML = `<div>Website code</div>`;
}
```

You can see the `variables` that are being generated by typing on the developer console: 

```js
console.log(window.variables);
/*
{
    includeCover: true, // if includeCover is true the algorithm should
    background: "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1511974035430-5de47d3b95da", // this is the url of the image that will used as background for the profile cover
    avatarURL: "https://randomuser.me/api/portraits/women/42.jpg", // this is the url for the profile avatar
    socialMediaPosition: "left", // social media bar position (left or right)
    
    twitter: null, // social media usernames
    github: "alesanchezr",
    linkedin: null,
    instagram: null,

    name: null,
    lastname: null,
    role: null,
    country: null,
    city: null
}
*/
